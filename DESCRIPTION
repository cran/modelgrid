Description: A minimalistic but flexible framework that facilitates the
    creation, management and training of multiple 'caret' models. A model grid
    consists of two components, (1) a set of settings that is shared by all
    models by default, and (2) specifications that apply only to the individual
    models. When the model grid is trained, model and training specifications are
    first consolidated from the shared and the model specific settings into
    complete 'caret' model configurations. These models are then trained with
    the 'train()' function from the 'caret' package.
